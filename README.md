# recipes.ai

Hello! Welcome to the recipes.ai github project.

As a university student, I don't have all the time in the world (especially as an engineering student ðŸ˜­). This also means that I don't have all the time in the world to cook amazing food for myself, or do research for new dishes and meals that would save more time.

Additionally, a lot of my friends do not even know how to cook.

That's why when I came up with the idea for this project, I was ecstatic.

The idea is simple: create a website that allows users to input the ingredients they have in their kitchen, and the website will output a list of recipes that can be made with those ingredients.
